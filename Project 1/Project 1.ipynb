    "Figure 5 shows a clearer network of the pipe placements. The shutoff valve for line 1 is positioned after the chiller to prevent bucking of the pump. The valves will be gate valves, since it is the most common type of valve. The loss per each gate valve is $K=8f_T$ (each line will have $C=8$ because this is the only loss considered that gets multiplied by $f_T$). The fittings used for this network will be standard tee (for splitting the flow) and elbow fittings (for changing direction). There is a lot of approximation when it comes to the fittings, but the major losses and losses across the air handling units for this case should triumph over the loss produced by the fittings, since the lengths of each pipe are thousands of feet. All pipes will have a loss due to the entrance and exit ($K=1.78$). Here is a description for the minor losses in each pipe (each fitting is visualized in Figure 4):\n",
