    "* Minimize the pipe length by placing lines in the same tunnel when feasible.\n",

    "* Use a \"Z\" network (shown in Figure 3).\n",
    "* Avoid pipe velocities much in excess of 9 feet per second.\n",

    "Figure 5 shows a clearer network of the pipe placements. The valves will be gate valves, since it is the most common type of shutoff valve. The loss per each gate valve is $K=8f_T$ (each line will have $C=8$ because this is the only loss considered that gets multiplied by $f_T$). The fittings used for this network will be standard tee (for splitting the flow) and elbow fittings (for changing direction). There is a lot of approximation when it comes to the fittings, but the major losses and losses across the air handling units for this case should triumph over the loss produced by the fittings, since the lengths of each pipe are thousands of feet. All the pipes will have a loss due to the entrance and exit for each individual pipe ($K=1.78$). The loss due to the tee connections will be ignored (only 8 tee connections total), but losses due to elbows will be considered due to the larger quantity ($K_{elbow}=0.75$). The number of elbows is estimated based on a change in direction looking down on the top plane (the point of view in the above figures) and the change in direction perpendicular to the top view (coming out or into the page from the point of view in the above figures). Here is a description for the minor losses in each pipe (each fitting is visualized in Figure 4):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pipe 1: It is possible with the mapping shown in Figure 2 and 4 for there to be no elbows because there is no change in direction on the top plane or an orthogonal plane coming out of the page. $K_1=1.78$\n",
    "* Pipe 2: There is one elbow to change direction toward airside 3 and 4 elbows to change direction coming into and out of the page. $K_2=1.78+5(0.75)=5.53$\n",
    "* Pipe 3: No changes in direction. $K_3=1.78$\n",
    "* Pipe 4: Contains an elbow to change direction toward airside 4 and four more due to the elevation change. $K_4=1.78+5(0.75)=5.53$\n",
    "* Pipe 5: There are 2 elbows to change direction toward airside 4. $K_5=1.78+2(0.75)=3.28$\n",
    "* Pipe 6: It has 2 elbows to change direction along the top plane. $K_6=1.78+2(0.75)=3.28$\n",
    "* Pipe 7: Contains no additional elbows. $K_7=1.78$\n",
    "* Pipe 8: Contains 5 elbows. $K_8=1.78+5(0.75)=5.53$\n",
    "* Pipe 9: Contains 7 elbows $K_9=1.78+7(0.75)=7.03$\n",
    "* Pipe 10: Contains four elbows for changing direction on the top plane and an additional four for elevation change. $K_{10}=1.78+8(0.75)=7.78$\n",

Because the additional loss required to reach a balance using turn down valves exceeds 50 in some pipes, this option will not be considered, nor attempted to further correct. Also, in order to gain more control over this type of analysis, turn down valves were added to all four lines (could not be avoided). This is not a good design because bucking of the pump would occur. Balancing using booster pumps is to be investigated."
