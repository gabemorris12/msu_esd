    "c. Generate a curve fit for H vs. Q for the main-line pump of part (b). Verify using the Hardy-Cross or Kirchhoff program that the selected pump is suitable. This means that the H-Q curve fit is to be placed in the Hardy-Cross or Kirchhoff program and the resulting flow rates in the individual loads are to be computed and compared with the required flow rates. Compute the power required for the pump including viscous corrections, if needed.\n",
    "d. The management team also wants a parallel pump arrangement, using identical pumps, for the main line to be examined. Booster pumps, if used, are the same as in Part (b). Select the required pump (model number, RPM, rotor diameter). A copy of the manufacturer’s pump performance information is needed. Use the Hardy-Cross or Kirchhoff program to find the behavior of the system with (1) both pumps in parallel and (2) only one of the parallel pumps in operation. This gives some idea of the system capability of the parallel arrangement if one pump is down. For the parallel analysis, determine the power required (including viscous corrections, if needed) for the two parallel pump operating conditions.\n",
